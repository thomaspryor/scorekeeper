# Setup git hooks for this repo by pointing core.hooksPath at scripts/hooks/.
# This makes the hooks version-controlled (vs the default .git/hooks/ which
# isn't tracked) so every clone gets the same secret-scan pre-commit check.
# core.hooksPath is clone-local git config — `git clone` does NOT carry it
# over, so this must be re-run on every fresh clone.
#
# This repo has no package.json/npm install step (vanilla JS, no build), so
# there's no postinstall hook to wire this into automatically. Run it once
# after cloning: ./scripts/setup-git-hooks.sh
# Idempotent. Safe to re-run.
